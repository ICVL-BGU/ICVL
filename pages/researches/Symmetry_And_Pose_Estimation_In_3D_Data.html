            <p>Knowing the poses of objects before their detection or classification has been shown to improve the results of object detectors. However, a robust and fine estimation of object poses is still challenging. To do just that, we suggest employing the mirror symmetry of objects, providing a part of the pose information. In our paper, we show how the symmetry of objects in 3D can be robustly detected (providing fine but partial pose information) and used to construct a partial pose invariant representation of objectsâ€™ shape, allowing state-of-the-art object detection.</p>

            <p>More information will be added following the ECCV2014 conference. In the meantime, you are invited to have a look at our paper described below.</p>
