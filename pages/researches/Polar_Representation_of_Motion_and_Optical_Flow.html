                <h2>Polar Representation of Motion and Optical Flow</h2>

                <p>Classical and contemporary optical flow algorithms aim to estimate image motion fields (a.k.a. optical flows) that emerge from scenes with rigid or articulated objects, i.e., motion fields with roughly piecewise smooth motions, and no turbulences or complicated singularities (and most often, just piecewise constant velocity). However, the variety of motions exhibited by natural or manmade phenomena clearly go beyond this class (see few examples in the images below, one of which are <a href="pages/researches/Specular_Flow.html">specular flows</a> that we exploit for specular shape inference in another line of research in the lab). To attempt better motion estimation even in these extreme conditions, we suggest studying complex optical flows in <strong>polar</strong> representation, where each element of the brightness motion field is represented by its magnitude and orientation instead of its Cartesian projections. This seemingly small change in representation provides more direct access to the intrinsic structure of the field and to make readily explicit certain statistical properties not observed in Cartesian representation. When used with the popular variational inference paradigm, it provides a framework in which regularizers can be intuitively tailored for very different classes of motion, including those complex motions that motivate this research from the start.</p>

                <p>Our evaluations reveal that a flow estimation algorithm that is based on a polar representation can perform as well or better than the state-of-the-art when applied to traditional (approximately piecewise constant) optical flow problems. But at the same time, it facilitates both qualitative and quantitative improvements for non-traditional cases such as fluid flows and specular flows, whose structure is very different.</p>
